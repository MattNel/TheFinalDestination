the module we were given is not a multi-phase process  and won't be released in an incremental way hence does not require additional attention in the sense that there will not be any future functionnality that will be added on the android module we have been given to test. If it was the case we would have answer affirmatively that there will be some remaining test but in our case there will not be any remaining test that will be carry on the android module because in our context this module is a stand alone application.
