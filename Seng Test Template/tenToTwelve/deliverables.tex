This section consists in enumerating with a brief description all what we have to deliver after testing the Android module which involves the “USER INTERFACE OF THE RESEARCH SUPPORT SYSTEM (RSS)”. The deliverables of this test will be as follow:
\begin{itemize}
        \item The Test plan document which is the document containing all the aspects of the testing; it describes the different activities that was done during the testing as well as the scope of testing , and the approach we had to take in testing the UI of the android module of the RSS.
        \item The Test cases: It is based on the functional and non-functional requirements.  The functional requirement consists of using mock object of Junit to apply the unit testing; and Android lint report is used for the quality requirement (non-functional requirement).

        \item Tools and their output: Two tools are used in the testing process. Robolectric Android which is a framework for unit testing that uses the Android SDK jar in order to test-drive the android module and  Android Lint Report for non-functional requirement.

        \item Errors logs and executions logs: are some screenshots of files that records some errors that occurs during the testing.

        \item Problem reports and corrective action: a corrective action was applied in the graddle file (file that manages dependencies in android studio) when opening the source code.     

NB: the only thing that will not be part of the test deliverables is the Android module.
