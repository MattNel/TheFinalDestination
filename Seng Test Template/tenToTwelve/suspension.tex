Application testing reach a finite point, through lint report, the project included many errors and application running on the device kept on crushing because of these errors identified.

Implementation of the application is poorly implemented with no respect to android fragments usage, these resulted in many switches between different views in the application that puts a strain on the deployed device resources and replication, this resulted in some test not being able to be ran as switching between views lack reference path to which view to go to next, with the use of android fragments this could have being avoided.

Gradle build with appropriate dependencies. A attempted connection to be made to a server was created but attempts to test should be stopped as its not used in the code.
