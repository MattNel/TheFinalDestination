The RSS Master Requirements and Design Specifications (version 0.1) did not give enough information on the expected functionality of the Android Module, as such assumptions will be made regarding the functional requirements of the module.

Assumed test items for the unit testing of the Android Module will include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Functional Requirements
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The Android UI should allow for access to all system modules that require user interaction.
			
			\item Each link and button should work
			\item All input boxes should allowed for input
			\item User input should be validate with respect to the required input
			\item The Android module should interact with a REST API to retrieve all necessary content that should be displayed on the UI.
			
			\item Usability
			
		\end{enumerate}
	 
\end{enumerate}
