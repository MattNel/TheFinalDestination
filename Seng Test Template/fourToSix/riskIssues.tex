One of the risks with this project is that the android module has too little documentation. This is a problem as it could lead to misunderstandings and confusion as the developers might not really know what is expected of them and could lead create something the client did not want. This confusion could have been cleared up by referring the developers to the web module documentation as that is somewhat similar to this module and could help give clarity to the developers on what is expected of them. \\
Another risk issue could be linked to the complexity of the android module. This module contains multiple interfaces and linking the interfaces to one another could be difficult and problematic for the developers.
