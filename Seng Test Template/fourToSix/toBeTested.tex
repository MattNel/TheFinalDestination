Usability
Priority :{ high}: 


Use of external mocks
Priority :{ high}: There were no use of external mocks

Gradle build with appropriate dependencies
Priority :{ high}: Dependencies in gradle build was partially implemented where a connection to a server was attempted but then it was not used anywhere in the code so was not successful.

Dependency Injection
Priority :{ high}: There was no use of dependency injection 

Use of fragments
Priority :{ high}: There was no use of fragments so the advantage of a more modular system fell away. The code was implemented in such a way that a new activity was just created and extended from the main activity. The code was hard coded in making maintenance on the code harder. 

Use of REST
Priority :{ high}: The use of REST was partially implemented and not done properly or was not completed. JSON object were created to store the user data but then it is stored locally in a file rather than using android features such as volley request or retro fit where you send the JSON objects to the back-end.
