The android module is to be tested. Since most of our team members (3 out of 5) have never used programmed an android module, they would need to be trained and taught how to use android studio which would take up our already limited time. Due to the aforementioned reason, it was decided that it would be better if the members that are already proficient programmers in android should focus on testing the module and the other members focus on writing the test plan and assisting with test reports and non-functional requirements.
