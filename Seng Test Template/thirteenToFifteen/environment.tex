In this section we look at some points that can appear to be environmental needs during the testing process and answer some of these environmental questions such as:

\begin{itemize}

     \item Will the system (the android module) be restricted of use during the testing? since the android module(user interface) we are testing his a stand alone module and not integrated to the entire system. it is not therefore an issue to verify wether or not the system should be restricted of use. but in the meanwhile for testing purpose the android module should be live runing.

     \item As an environmental needs we needed to run the android code of the user interface on  the latest version of Android Studio (Android Studio 2.1.1). 

      \item We do not required any special power, but just the normal electric power that could make a laptop to be on.

      \item  As another environmental need we had to look on how our the test data will be provide. in the testing process we will be using ock object to test against the functional requirement and we will also use input  from the keyboard. 
 
       \item In this project we are not using simulators(special hardware), either static generator.

       \item The component of the android module are tested thoroughly as a whole.
\end{itemize}
