This is a Unit Test plan for the Research Support System (RSS) Android Application Framework (Android Module) and it will only address the RSS Android Module as implemented by team Alpha of the COS 301 mini project.\\
The RSS Android Module is being tested in isolation of all the other system modules, as such this test plan will cover one level of testing, namely Unit testing.\\
The purpose of this test plan is to document the testing requirements of the RSS Android Module as well as outline the testing procedure of the RSS Android Module. Only the functional and non-functional requirements will be considered. The basis of the requirements to be tested are in the RSS Master Requirements and Design Specifications (version 0.1). \\
The RSS Android module consists of the Android User Interface to the RSS, as such to test the functional requirements automated UI tests will be done.
%In the testing of the functional requirements, the following criteria will be considered:
There are eleven non-functional requirements to be tested.

In addition to the above requirements, the Android Module will be assessed in line with the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Front-end process demo
	\item Usability
	\item Use of external mocks
	\item Gradle build with appropriate dependencies
	\item Use of Dependency Injection
