Nowadays risks planification and contingencies are part of the planning of any project. In this particular project we had to consider some aspects which appear as risks such as: 

\begin{itemize}
 
     \item  The availability of the human ressources, software, hardware and tools that we needed before carry on with the testing. We arranged all of these before the 10 May 2016 . 

      \item In order to avoid late delivery, progress meeting was scheduled to know the level of each member and the difficulties he/she may have in the process.

      \item Avoiding delay due to training on a specific technology or tools: we made that each member should be assigned a task according to his level of knowledge and training and prerequisites.     

       \item We do not have a case of a contingency due to a change of requirements. 

\end{itemize}
